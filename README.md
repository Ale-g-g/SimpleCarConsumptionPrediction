# SimpleCarConsumptionPrediction
Very simple Multiple Regression model to predict car consumption with scikit-learn

Using a very clean dataset from US cars to estimate consumption using different parameters as weight, year, cylinder number, and so on.

Currently studying a Data Science Master, and this was one of the first projets. My first attempt to work with Git.

Feel free to improve it, my goal here is to learn as much as I can, as I am Industrial Engineer and, let's say, programming is quite new for me!
