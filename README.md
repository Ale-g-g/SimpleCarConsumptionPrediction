# SimpleCarConsumptionPrediction
Very simple Multiple Regression model to predict car consumption with scikit-learn

Using a very clean dataset from US cars to estimate consumption using different parameters as weight, year, cylinder number, and so on.

Currently studying a Data Science Master, and this was one of the first projets. My first attempt to work with Git.
